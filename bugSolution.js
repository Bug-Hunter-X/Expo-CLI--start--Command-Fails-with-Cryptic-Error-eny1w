The solution often involves carefully reviewing your `package.json` and `app.json` files. Look for any typos, missing dependencies, or version conflicts. Use `npm install` or `yarn install` to install any missing packages.  If you suspect an issue with a specific package, try temporarily removing it to see if that resolves the error.  You might also need to clear the cache and restart. Here's example code to address the common case of a missing dependency:

```javascript
// bug.js (Illustrative - might not be your exact issue)
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native'; //Missing dependency causing error
import MissingPackage from 'missing-package'; //Missing dependency causing error

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
// Install the missing package
npm install react-native missing-package // Or yarn add react-native missing-package

//Then restart the Expo CLI
//Clear the cache if it still does not work
expo prebuild --clean
expo start
```
