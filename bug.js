This error typically occurs when using Expo's `start` command to launch your app and involves issues with the project's configuration or dependencies.  The error message might not be super specific but often relates to issues with the metro bundler, which is Expo's build system.  Common underlying causes could be incorrect package versions, missing native modules, problems with your `app.json` or `package.json`, or conflicts between Expo packages and other libraries.
